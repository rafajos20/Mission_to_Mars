# Mission_to_Mars
## Overview
Automate a browser to scrape multiple sites to extract data and images (Beautifulsoup, Splinter). Once extracted, storing the info in a NoSQL database (MongoDB). Then using Flask, create a web application to display the data and images.

## Process
###  1. Scraping.py
* Beautifulsoup and Splinter; drill down into the HTML tags to extract the most recent news article and summary from Mars News site.
* Beautifulsoup and Splinter; drill down into the HTML tags to extract the most recent image from Space Images site.
* Pandas; scrape Mars/Earth table and read as DataFrame then convert into HTML from Mars Facts site.
* Beautifulsoup and Splinter; drill down into the HTML tags to extract all four full size hemisphere images from Mars Hemisphere site.
* Store scraped data in MongoDB database.


###  2. App.py
* create app to connect MongoDB through Flask to set up web page.
###  3. Index.html
* create containers to display news article, images, and table.
* create 'Scrape New Data' button to perform our scraping function.
* refactor code to ensure data displayed is responsive to multiple device sizes.
* Bootstrap; customize web page appearance(background color change, jumbotron image fill, button color change, text color change).
